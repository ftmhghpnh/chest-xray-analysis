# chest-xray-analysis

Abstractâ€”Chest radiography is the most common imaging examination
globally, critical for screening, diagnosis and managing
many life-threatening diseases. Recognizing different diseases is
not easy, even for experts and computer-aided recognition system
can be much beneficial. In this project, a deep neural network
architecture proposed to automatically identify some of the most
important chest diseases by looking at the X-ray image. The
performance of the designed model compared with previous
works and it shows comparable performance.


- Developed a deep neural network for automatic identification of chest diseases from X-ray images using machine learning.
- Trained the model on a large dataset and used a convolutional neural network with a softmax classifier to make predictions.
- Evaluated the model's performance using standard metrics, showing comparable results to previous works and potential for aiding medical professionals in disease recognition and improving patient outcomes.
