# chest-xray-analysis

Abstractâ€”Chest radiography is the most common imaging examination
globally, critical for screening, diagnosis and managing
many life-threatening diseases. Recognizing different diseases is
not easy, even for experts and computer-aided recognition system
can be much beneficial. In this project, a deep neural network
architecture proposed to automatically identify some of the most
important chest diseases by looking at the X-ray image. The
performance of the designed model compared with previous
works and it shows comparable performance.
